                    C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed as an enhancement of the C language to include object-oriented paradigm. It is an imperative and a compiled language.

                    C++ is a middle-level language rendering it the advantage of programming low-level (drivers, kernels) and even higher-level applications (games, GUI, desktop apps etc.). The basic syntax and code structure of both C and C++ are the same. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some of the features & key-points to note about the programming language are as follows:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <span>Simple:</span> It is a simple language in the sense that programs can be broken down into logical units and parts, has a rich library support and a variety of data-types.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span>Machine Independent but Platform Dependent:</span>  A C++ executable is not platform-independent (compiled programs on Linux wonâ€™t run on Windows), however they are machine independent.
                    </li>                   
                    <li>
                        <span>Mid-level language: </span>It is a mid-level language as we can do both systems-programming (drivers, kernels, networking etc.) and build large-scale user applications (Media Players, Photoshop, Game Engines etc.)
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    This is the first program in C++ which printing the "Hello world" on the terminal or console.
