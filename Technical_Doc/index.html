                    C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed as an enhancement of the C language to include object-oriented paradigm. It is an imperative and a compiled language.

                    C++ is a middle-level language rendering it the advantage of programming low-level (drivers, kernels) and even higher-level applications (games, GUI, desktop apps etc.). The basic syntax and code structure of both C and C++ are the same.

                    Some of the features & key-points to note about the programming language are as follows:

                        Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
              objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
              For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
              elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
              clicks, form input, and page navigation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
                        objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
                        server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
                        database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to
                        another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a
                        server.
